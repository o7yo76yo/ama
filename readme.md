# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new/choose) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20-label%3Ahidden)

Instead of asking questions by email, whatsapp, messenger, etc, and answer privately, this way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever. But I have privilege to not answer your question :)

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
